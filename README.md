# DevTing
DevTing is a small macOS app written in swift to play a sound on connection of a USB device and removal of a USB device.
Can use:
* The built in sounds
* Any system sound
* A custom sound for both connecting and disconnecting items

It was written mostly because I've never liked how silent connections or disconnects were, but after having a device that was malfuncitoning and not knowing it was constantly unplugging and re-plugging, this app alerted me to that so I could narrow it down.

Otherwise, it's purely an aesthetic choice.
